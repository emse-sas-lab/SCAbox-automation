"""Python library

This library provide the abstractions needed to represent
the side channel-attack pipeline.

It allows to code your own scripts without using
the high-level API.
This can be useful especially if you want to have a behavior
during acquisition or processing that is not provided by the API.

The library allows to do the following tasks programmatically :

* Acquire side-channel data
* Acquire channel data
* Parse the data
* Export and import data
* Apply basic filtering
* Compute attack models
* Compute correlation
* Compute guess and related stats
